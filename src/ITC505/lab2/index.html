    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>This section is dedicated to explaining the structural choices made while converting the resume into HTML format. The use of semantic HTML tags such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h3&gt; helps in structuring the content in a meaningful, organized manner that enhances both readability and accessibility. The &lt;article&gt; tag encompasses the entire resume content, indicating it as a standalone piece of content, while another &lt;article&gt; tag is used for this addendum to keep explanations distinct from the main content.</p>
